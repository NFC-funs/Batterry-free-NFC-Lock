The finished Tag Emulator serves as a core component for battery-free NFC lock solutions. 

Leveraging passive NFC energy harvesting technology, it supports secure, wire-free unlocking operations, 

making it ideal for low-power, maintenance-free access control scenarios.

Two publicly available analogous product solutions have been discovered for reference:

1.  https://www.holtek.com/page/applications/detail/WAS-2331

The proposed approach employs a combination of a dual-interface NFC chip and a low-power consumption MCU, where an extra group of antennas is utilized to capture energy for driving the motor.

2.  https://www.infineon.com/part/NAC1080

This solution boasts high integration, implementing all functions on a single chip. Unfortunately, the chip in question has been discontinued.

This solution leverages the CW32L010 to implement NFC communication, eliminating the need for a dedicated NFC chip and resulting in extremely low costs.
